# AMI_SS2022
This repository contains our project AMI SS 2022 at TUM. We implement a car damage detection algorithm based on YOLO5 and develop a interactive website as frontend. The software stack is well dockerized. The source code and data to train our machine learning model  are not uploaded due to data protection.
